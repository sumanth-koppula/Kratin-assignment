The application is intended to provide a user-friendly interface for elderly users like Sunita Sharma, who are aged 65 or above, to organize their medications and ensure they adhere to their prescribed schedules.

Key Features:

Medication Management: The application allows users to add, view, and delete their medications. Each medication entry consists of a name, dosage, and schedule.

Accessible Web Application: The web application is accessible through a web browser, making it easily accessible on various devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones.

Use Case Scenario:
Suppose Sunita Sharma, who is 70 years old, is managing multiple medications for her health conditions. She often struggles to remember when to take each medication and sometimes forgets to take them on time, affecting her health management. The Medication Reminder application comes to her aid by allowing her to add details about her medications, including their names, dosages, and schedules.
